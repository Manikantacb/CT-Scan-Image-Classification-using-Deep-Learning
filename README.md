# CT-Scan-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
In this report i have researched about CT scans of patients with and without lung complications. The number of lung complications has increased in the pandemic amongst patients. There was need to analyze the scans to figure out which all patients are healthy, having preexisting conditions and having serious conditions.It is known that patients with serious condition required immediate attention and there is need to figure out such patients.The given data is highly imbalanced on label ’1’,’2’. So, I have used oversampling using SMOTE to increase the data set.For this problem set i have designed a classifier using neural networks. I have created couple of models for training purpose.I have considered a simple neural network of three layers, a Lenet model created on my own and a VGG model, VGG model with augmentation and VGG model with augmentation and dropout. After training all the models for multiple epochs between 15-25 using early stopping to prevent over fitting, it is found VGG model has the best accuracy 0.93 on and macro ROC AUC score of 0.92 on the test data.
